React takes logos as `children` (one element per logo), matching the source. Svelte takes
`items` (plain data) plus a `logo` snippet that renders one item, since a Svelte snippet
can't be split apart and reassembled the way React children can.

## No motion library

The source used `motion/react`. This port is CSS only: each cycle keys a fresh element in
and animates it in with `.logo-carousel-enter`, while the outgoing element animates out on
`.logo-carousel-exit` and is removed from the DOM once its `animationend` fires, so nothing
lingers as dead weight between cycles.

## Paused, not just slowed, when nobody can see it

An `IntersectionObserver` stops the interval entirely once the carousel scrolls out of
view, and a `visibilitychange` listener does the same when the tab itself is hidden. Idle
columns spend zero timers running for content nobody is looking at.

Needs `chart` and `counter`. For a plain dial, use `gauge` instead.

A gauge is a single reading, so it is a `role="meter"` with a formatted `aria-valuetext`
rather than a keyboard-walked plot. Pass `label` to name it.

When `value` changes, notches switch on and off in a ripple from the old edge, and the
printed value counts from the previous reading.

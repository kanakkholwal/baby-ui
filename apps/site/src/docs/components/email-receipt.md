Built from the [Email Kit](/emails/email-kit), themed from your tokens and switched to your dark palette when the inbox is. Every amount and date is a string you format first (`Intl.NumberFormat`, `Intl.DateTimeFormat`), so the email matches your invoices exactly and never guesses a locale. `adjustments` sit between the items and the total for subtotals, discounts and tax. Rename or translate any label through `labels`.

`design` picks the look: `summary` (the default) puts the items and total in a panel under a large heading, with a dark footer bar; `classic` is a plain card.

## Send it

Render and send it exactly like the [Welcome Email](/emails/email-welcome): render HTML and plain text on the server, then pass both to your provider. Swap the component and its props.

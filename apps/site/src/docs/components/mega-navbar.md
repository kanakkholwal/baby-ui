One shared panel resizes and slides between desktop triggers instead of a fresh popover
mounting per item, so moving along the row reads as the panel morphing to the next group.

## Not a menu

The panel holds links to pages, not commands, so it's a disclosure pattern rather than
`role="menu"`: the browser's own link semantics are what a screen reader should hear.

## Mobile is a real sheet

Below `md`, the trigger opens a full-height sheet: one accordion section open at a time,
plus the same `links`/`actions` data the desktop row uses. Navigating (an `active` change)
closes it automatically.

## Notched variant

`variant="notched"` hangs the whole row from the top edge on a card-coloured
[Notched Shelf](/components/blocks/notched-shelf), leaving the page visible on either
side. The mega panel drops from the shelf the same way it drops from the solid bar.
Below `md` it becomes a plain bar with a hairline rule that fades in once the page
scrolls, and the sheet drops from the top instead of sliding in from the side.

## Just the menu

`MegaMenu` is the desktop row on its own: triggers, the shared panel, hover intent and
keyboard, without the bar, brand or mobile sheet. Drop it into a header you already have
and pass the same `groups` and `active`. The panel centres under the open trigger, clamped
to the row's start and the window's edge.

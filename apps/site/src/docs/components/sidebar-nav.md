Collapsing shrinks the sidebar to its icon rail without moving a single icon — only the
labels fade and slide out, so nothing reflows underneath a fixed cursor position.

## Built on the real DropdownMenu

The workspace switcher composes this registry's own `DropdownMenu`, not a hand-rolled
`position: fixed` popup with its own outside-click listener — positioning, dismissal and
keyboard handling all come from that primitive.

## No fictional default

`workspace`, `navItems` and `recents` are all required — the workspace name, nav items and
chat history are the whole point of the sidebar, so there's no built-in sample content.

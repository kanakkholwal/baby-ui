Built from the [Email Kit](/emails/email-kit), themed from your tokens and switched to your dark palette when the inbox is. The warning tells readers who didn't ask that their password is unchanged, and links to `securityUrl` when you pass one. Keep `expiresIn` short; an hour is typical.

`design` picks the look: `hero` (the default) opens with a tinted panel showing `requestedAt`, then a full-width button and a footer band; `classic` is a plain card with the warning as a callout.

## Send it

Render and send it exactly like the [Welcome Email](/emails/email-welcome): render HTML and plain text on the server, then pass both to your provider. Swap the component and its props.

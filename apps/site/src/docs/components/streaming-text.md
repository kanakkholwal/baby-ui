Words reveal one at a time and stop, the same contract `ResponseStream` uses, so a real
answer is never stuck replaying itself. Actions, the sources list and follow-up prompts
fade in together once every word has revealed.

## Citations are structural, not styled text

A token is either a word or `{ text: "", cite: n }`, which places a chip for `sources[n]`
inline. `sources` and `content` are both required: an answer's actual words and citations
are domain content, not something this component invents a fictional default for.

## No decoration without a handler

Copy always works, reading the assembled plain text straight off `content`. Retry and the
thumbs-up/down feedback buttons only render when you pass `onRetry`/`onFeedback` — a button
that looks actionable and does nothing is not something this component ships.

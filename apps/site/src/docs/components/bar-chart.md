Needs `chart`. Each `<Bar dataKey>` registers a series, so grouping, stacking, the value
domain, tooltip rows, summary and data table follow the bars you render. Hiding a series
in the legend collapses its bars to the baseline and the rest retween.

`BarXAxis` and `BarYAxis` swap roles with `orientation`: whichever runs along the
categories shows category labels, the other shows value ticks.

Render `BarTooltip` before the bars so its hover band sits behind them.

`variant="squares"` quantises each bar into square cells; `variant="depth"` adds side and
lid faces toward the chart centre and pulses the active bar. Set `texture` on a `Bar` when
colour alone must not carry the series.

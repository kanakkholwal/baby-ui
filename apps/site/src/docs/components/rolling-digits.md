Only the digits that change roll, each keyed from the right so a value gaining a digit
opens a new column instead of shifting the rest. Rapid updates queue `stepMs` apart, or
set `coalesce` to jump straight to the latest.

The springs are sampled into CSS keyframes, so the bounce matches the original with no
animation library. Ticker is the steadier odometer alternative.

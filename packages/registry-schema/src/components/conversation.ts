			"A `ResizeObserver` on both the scroll viewport and the transcript catches content growth (streaming replies, images loading in) and keeps following without waiting for a scroll event.",

			'The transcript is `role="log"` with `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-relevant="additions text"`, so assistive tech announces new turns without re-reading the whole history.',
